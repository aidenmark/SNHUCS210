# Response Questions

1.  Summarize the project and what problem it was solving

The project I have submitted is from Module 3.  This project was to develop an object-oriented programming (OOP) application to create two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input.

2.  What did you do particularly well?

What I think I did particularly well was commenting throughtout the code so that it was easy to follow and understand.

3.  Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Where I could enhace my code or make improvements is to maybe find a way to condense the amount of if-else statments that were used.

4.  Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Areas of the project that I found the most challenging to write were the function to display the clock.  This was because I had to manually code the stars for the clock to visiblly look appealing.  I had to do some research on Google and YouTube to find ways to best achieve the display of the clock.

5.  What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Skills that I will use in projects in the future is the ability to add source files to a project to integrate multiple languages.

6.  How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptbalb by commenting well throughout the code and creating variables and functions with easy to understand names that can easily be changed or manipulated in the future.
